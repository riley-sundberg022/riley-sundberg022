## Riley Q. Sundberg
Hello! My name is Riley. I was born and raised on the beautiful Eastern Foothills of the Rocky Mountains; on the historic and current lands of Apaches, Utes, Cheyennes, Comanches, Arapahoes, and other first peoples with these lands. I am a passionate and curious human, currently studying at MSU of Denver for a Biology of Science Degree with a GIS minor. I have four years of experience with ecological restoration/land stewardship work, with <a href="https://www.wrv.org/"> Wildland Restoration Volunteers </a> and a season with Bear Creek Lake Park. 7 years combined experience as a Department or volunteer lead, and a current research intern with ESIIL Stars Earth Data Science Lab. I am looking to contribute more to the beauty and understanding of this world. I am fascinated with ecology, particularly botanical aspects, interactions, and the potential of Geographic Information Systems to expand data analysis and knowledge for implementing and communicating solutions. I am interested in helping create a more equitable world beyond our current systems of oppression, focused on GDP and growth, to systems where the people have the power and ecological resilience and health, and we as a part of that ecology, are the priority.

Here is a migration map of the Tasiyagnunpa migration (or Western Meadowlark, or _Sturnella neglecta_) Tasiyagnunpa is the Lakota name of the Western Meadowlark
